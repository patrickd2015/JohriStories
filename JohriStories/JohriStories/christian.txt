Abhishek has always been a chatty guy. People joke that you can always hear Abhishek before you see Him. Unfortunately, His segue’s into conversations aren’t always the most elegant. 

At the 2014 Saint Louis FIRST Robotics championships, Abhishek and His two friends, Anurag and Akshat, were up in the stands watching the final championship matches. As usual, before the match, the MC ran around the field introducing the competing teams. It was customary for the team to do a little dance as they were introduced - Abhishek’s team, the Funky Monkeys of Lynbrook High School, often did a little monkey dance. 

Well, the members of Team 254, Bellarmine College Preparatory, chose to do a version of what seemed like the Harlem shake. It involved leaning back with their knees bent and heads thrown back while violently moving their shoulders and dangling their arms behind them. Anurag knew of these members - his name was Christian. 

“And on the Blue Alliance, we have Team 254, the Cheesy Poofs from Bellarmine College Prep!!” the MC announced. The Bellarmine team began its usual dance. 

“Hey look its Christian!” Anurag said to Akshat, pointing at one of the Bellarmine team’s members. Abhishek, who had just entered the scene, and who was itching to get in on the conversation, chimed right in, “Yeah, I know, it’s a Christian thing!”.

. . . No Abhishek, the Harlem Shake is not in any way affiliated with the Christian faith.
