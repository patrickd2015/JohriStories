Many times in these stories you may have seen Abhishek’s ability to save other beings and the world. I think its time for us to explain this to you. See Abhishek Johri has a black hole in stomach. But this black hole is special, it creates a gravitational pull like a regular planet may have. Some of us have direct experience with orbiting the Abhishek. 

TRUE STORY: One Winter day in sophomore year I was holding a decently large aluminum foil. A strong wind flew in from below the aluminum foil and flew over the entire language building to land mere feet away from Abhishek on the other side of the building. 	

In another instance, the Abhishek’s gravitational pull was powerful enough to hold the Earth together when the world was supposed to end in 2012. He was our savior, and we shall always grovel before His sheer power. His gravity and His black hole have saved us many times to date and will continue to do so in the future.
