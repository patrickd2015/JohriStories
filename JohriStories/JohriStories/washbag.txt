When it comes to the anatomy of the great Abhishek Johri, nothing stands out more than Abhishek's abdomen, or in more casual terms, His abs. Like all of Johri’s fascinating stories, His abs also has a very engrossing tale behind them.

‘Twas the autumn of the great Johri’s sophomore year through His quest to absolutely conquer Lynbrook High School with His alluring charm. In the strenuous World Literature class of the highly-esteemed Mr. Fritz Torp, there was a seriously heated discussion ensuing over the abdominal muscles of the homo sapiens. The conversation reached a snag when we were unable to describe to the class, what the purest and finest abdominal muscles looked like.

What mankind is still unable to explain to this day is how we were initially unable to spot perfect abs with the great Johri being present in the room. Finally, the keen eye of Fritz Torp caught sight of our handsome wonder of the world, and upon setting his eyes on this masterpiece, he exclaimed with great frivolity “Abhishek, do you have any abs?”

Abhishek responded with great gusto “of course, I’ve got quite the six pack right here.”

This response of His was met with great contradiction from the ever so keen Torp, who exclaimed “impossible Abhishek! You don’t have a six pack, you have washbags for abs! I think that’s what we’re going to call you from now on: WashBag!”

What a name it was: WashBag. A name that not only summarizes Abhishek’s ever so amazing abs, but also embodies His entire persona very accurately. To call Abhishek a douchebag is a big folly; but to call Him a WashBag, well that, my dear friends, is an entirely different story.
