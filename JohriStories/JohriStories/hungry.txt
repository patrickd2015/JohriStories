In Junior year, Abhishek Johri was enrolled in AP Language and Composition class. It was quite regrettable that this class was right before lunch. One fine day in the Spring, Abhishek was sitting next to me (and through me the collective authors of this entire presentation), and He decided that He was hungry. 

Many of you have seen dragons and trolls and other monsters in movies and have heard them growling and roaring and whatnot. Now take these low roars and imagine them emitting from the mouth of Abhishek in the following manner: “HUUUNNNNGGGGRRRRYYYYYY.” 

He literally growled just because he was hungry. 

When Abhishek was asked why He chose to do this, His answer was, “I was really hungry.” The Great Abhishek is such an honest man that He chooses to notify those around Him in the crudest manner possible of His most basic needs. So next time you hear the low rumble begin to come from Abhishek, hide your food, hide your skin, hide your soul.
