Beginning in the new year of 2013, We the representatives of The Great Abhishek Johri decided that it was a good time for the world to know the truth. The truth that would set them free. 

	Contrary to the predictions of many experts, namely the Mayans, the world did not, in fact, end on December 21st, 2012. Most believe that the Mayans were simply deluded, but in reality, there was a very grave danger threatening our very existence. 

	A planet made completely out of anti-matter was due to transcend the dimensions that divide us from the world of anti-matter, and it was going annihilate the planet Earth. Luckily, however, The One and Only Abhishek Johri was there to save the day. He was able to harness the power of reverse polarity and create a field of anti-gravity, thus banishing the planet back to its ethereal prison. 

	From that moment onwards, Abhishek Johri, or our most amazing savior, was appointed as Head Chairman of World Defense by the United Nation, was awarded three nobel peace prizes, was given permission to rule as King of Canada, which He respectfully declined as He wished to focus on His academics at Lynbrook High school, stop the war in the Middle East, unite Korea, and bring unicorns back into existence. 
	
	After 10 days of careful deliberation, we the council decided to create a Facebook page to honor our Glorious Savior, titled “Abhishek Johri 2013,” 2013 because His Holiness allowed us to see light of the new year, the new age. Shortly after, the hashtag #aj2013 was used to reference our Great Champion, in addition to any feat on the levels of Hercules combined with Chuck Norris. For instance, “I was able to complete my Oedipus Study Guide for APlit before midnight and still had enough time to cure cancer before morning!” #aj2013
