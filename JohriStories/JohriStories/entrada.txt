    Recognize that the very molecules that make up your body, the atoms that construct the molecules, are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centers of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of Johri. So that we are all connected to each other through Johri, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically. It’s not that we are better than Johri, we are part of Johri. We are in Johri and Johri is in us.

	Such is the truth behind the omnipotent, awe-inspiring powers of Johri the combatant in the realm of Pokemon and Yugioh trading card games, and much is the devastating potency by which Johri protects the world from devastation and unites all peoples within our nation. He surpasses even the Egyptian Gods in His might. Johri is judge, jury, and arbiter; He equally denounces the evils of both truth and love, and His reach extends to the stars above, and He is and forever shall be the Heart of the Cards. One can only surrender now. Enemies, mishappenings, and Mother Nature try to prepare to fight, but to no avail. That’s right.

	The Angels of Abhishek welcome you well into the well of human thought and sentiment. Here is represented a microcosm of love and hate, yin and yang, right and wrong, Johri and un-Johri. You unlock this hallowed place with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension - a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into the Abhishek Zone.
