Abhishek Johri Day is, has been, and will always be on each April 22. The importance of the day is explained in this statement: “In the truest spirit of Abhishek day, His followers honor Him by carrying out their lives in peace; something only made possible by His Magnanimity. Oh Beautiful Glorious Day, indeed it is.”

What is not as well known is the origin of Abhishek Day. On April 22, 2011, in the days before blasted Google Hangouts, when all sane people could use Google Chat, Miles set his chat status to “ha.” The actual reason why Miles did this is not important, and has been lost in the mists of time.

Abhishek almost instantly messaged Miles, curious as to what He was missing out on. Little did Abhishek know that for once in His life, He wasn’t missing out on anything. Not yet, that is!

Before long, other people started setting “ha” as their statuses. Throughout the evening, the word spread. Nobody would tell Abhishek what was so funny. Abhishek wasn’t about to play along though. He had to know the reason why everyone was laughing!

	So in typical Johri fashion, He broadcast His confusion to the world through all forms of social media, including Facebook. And that was when He realized that everyone was laughing at Him! For a brief span of time that glorious night, Abhishek made everyone happy. A true gift to society, that it was. This event highlighted the now universally accepted truth that all good things in life are the result of the great HERPE Johri’s existence.

And that is why we continue to celebrate Abhishek Johri Day by doing absolutely nothing except live our daily lives in peace. This represents the true spirit of Abhishek Johri Day, as such things are only possible because of His HERPE-ness.
