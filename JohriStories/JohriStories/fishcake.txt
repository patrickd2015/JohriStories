Abhishek was a fellow Españoler back in the seventh grade Hegland heyday. I don’t know what it was about His name - it was pretty easy for me to pronounce, but I guess for others, maybe not so much. Gary Chen. This guy came up with the “fishcake” proposition - I guess he was bending it a little bit but maybe fishcake and Abhishek were homonyms. Anyways, whenever Abhishek tried to answer a question, hoots of “fishcake” would ring across the room. I wasn’t there to witness it in other Spanish classes, especially in High School, but my guess is that it died down since we weren’t allowed to speak any English anyways. Abhishek’s also very lucky that “Pastel de Pescado” isn’t quite as catchy, something I tried to push in seventh grade . . .

We have to give Abhishek credit where credit is due - we joke and play around with him a lot and he takes all of this respectively. So major props for being the great sport you are, Abhishek.
