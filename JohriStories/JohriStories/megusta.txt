In honor of Abhishek, we composed a song in the wee years of 7th grade. The lyrics were: 

Abhishek, Abhishek, como me gusta la Abhishek
Translated: Abhishek, Abhishek, oh how much I like the Abhishek
(repeat x)
alternatively: Abhishek, Abhishek, no-o me gusta la Abhishek
Translated: Abhishek, Abhishek, I do not like the Abhishek
(repeat x)
